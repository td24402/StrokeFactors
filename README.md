# StrokeFactors
In this project, the primary objective is to explore factors contributing to strokes, focusing on gender differences, diseases such as hypertension and heart disease, and BMI. We will analyze a dataset, beginning with the creation of a word cloud to highlight key themes related to stroke, health, and wellness. Following this, we will delve into the dataset, examining features and relationships using a correlation matrix and heatmap. Gender distribution will be visualized through color-coding, with explanations provided. Smoking status and residence type will be explored through various graphical representations. Additionally, we will identify the most common work type and present it as a percentage in a pie chart. Countplots will be generated to examine the relationships between stroke and hypertension, as well as stroke and heart disease. Explorations into age distribution, smoking status, residence type, BMI, and glucose levels will be carried out using various visualizations such as KDE plots, histograms, joint plots, and swarm plots. Scatterplots and catplots will further illuminate relationships between age, gender, profession type, and glucose or BMI levels. In conclusion, we will summarize key findings, offering insights into the factors associated with strokes. Any references used in the report will be included for transparency and credibility.
